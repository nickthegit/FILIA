        users’ personal information. This privacy policy applies with respect to
        the information that Filia collects from its telephone operators,
        website ("Website"), located at www.filia.solar, and all web pages
        accessible through the Website. When Filia collects and uses your
        personal information, it is done so in compliance with the Data
        Protection Act 1998 and, from the 25th of May 2018, the General Data
        Protection Regulation (GDPR). Filia is the responsible as a ‘controller’
        of that personal data. Amendments to this privacy policy will be posted
        at this URL and will be effective when posted. Your continued use of
        this site following the posting of any amendment, modification or change
        shall constitute your acceptance of the terms thereof
      </p>
      <h2>INFORMATION COLLECTED</h2>
      <p>
        Filia collects non-personally identifiable information about you in a
        number of ways, including tracking your activities through your IP
        (Internet Protocol) address, computer settings, most-recently visited
        URL, or through cookies (described below). Filia may also ask you to
        provide certain non-personally identifiable information about yourself,
        such as your age, your occupation, buying preferences, interest in Filia
        , etc. Filia does not collect personally identifiable information about
        you unless you voluntarily submit such information to the Solar BB
        Website by, for example but not limited too; filling out a contact
        request form, survey or registration form, requesting literature,
        abandoning your purchase at checkout or emailing an online calculator
        quotation. The types of information that may be requested include your
        name, address, e-mail address, and telephone number.
      </p>
      <h2>USE OF INFORMATION</h2>
      <p>
        Filia may use the information to tell you about Filia products and
        services that we feel may be of legitimate interest to you. Personally
        identifiable information may be used to contact you again either by
        online electronic communication (such as e-mail), or by regular mail or
        telephone. Filia users may opt-out of receiving future mailings from
        Filia by unsubscribing from Filia emails or other contacts by emailing
        info@filia.solar. Please be aware that if you opt-out of receiving
        promotional email from Filia, it may take up to ten business days to
        process your opt-out request, and you may receive promotional email from
        us during that period. Additionally, even after you opt-out from
        receiving promotional messages from Filia, you will continue to receive
        administrative messages regarding our services.
      </p>
      <p>
        Filia has the right to monitor the Filia Website electronically, from
        time to time, and to disclose any information necessary to satisfy any
        law, regulation, or other government request, to operate the Filia
        Website properly, or to protect itself. Non-personal demographic and
        profile data is used to tailor your experience at the Filia Website,
        showing you content Filia thinks you might be interested in. This
        information may also be shared with Filia’s dealers, distributors or
        contractors on an aggregate, non-personal basis. When Filia shares such
        information with dealers, distributors or contractors, it is not
        traceable to any particular user and will not be used to contact you.
      </p>
      <h2>DATA RETENTION</h2>
      <p>
        Filia only keeps your personal information for as long as is necessary,
        to be able to use it for the reasons given in this privacy policy, and
        for as long as Filia are required to keep it by law. The actual period
        for which Solar BB stores your personal information will vary depending
        on the type of personal information and how it is used. For example,
        when you buy a product from Filia, the information is stored about you
        and your purchase for at least the term of your warranty or guarantee.
      </p>
      <h2>USE OF IP ADDRESSES</h2>
      <p>
        Filia uses your IP address to help diagnose problems with its servers
        and to administer the quality of the Filia Website. Filia does not use
        IP addresses to personally identify users and does not track the usage
        patterns of individual users, but rather how well each page on the Filia
        site performs overall.
      </p>
      <h2>USE OF COOKIES</h2>
      <p>
        When you view the Filia Website, Filia may store some information on
        your computer. This information will be in the form of a "cookie" or
        similar file. Cookies are small pieces of information stored on your
        hard drive, not on the Filia Website. Cookies do not spy on you or
        otherwise invade your privacy, and they cannot invade your hard drive
        and steal information. Rather, they help you navigate a website as
        easily as possible. Filia uses cookies to deliver content specific to
        your interests. Cookies can allow the Filia Website to remember you when
        you return so you do not have to enter your registration data at each
        connection.
      </p>
      <h2>SECURITY</h2>
      <p>
        The Filia Website uses industry standard security measures to protect
        the loss, misuse and alteration of the information under its control.
        While there is no such thing as "perfect security" on the Internet,
        Filia will take reasonable steps to protect the safety of your personal
        information. If you have created an account with Filia, we urge you to
        keep your password in a safe place and not to divulge it to anyone.
        Also, remember to sign off your account and close your browser window
        when you have finished your visit. This is to ensure that others cannot
        access your account, especially if you are sharing a computer with
        someone else or are using a computer in a public place such as a library
        or Internet café.
      </p>
      <h2>CORRECTION AND UPDATE OF INFORMATION</h2>
      <p>
        Solar BB allows its users the option to change or remove information
        previously provided. This may be done through e-mailing the information
        to changed or removed to info@filia.solar. Filia will use reasonable
        efforts to ensure that your information is removed from or corrected in
        our records.
      </p>
      <h2>CHILDREN'S PRIVACY (UNDER THE AGE OF 13)</h2>
      <p>
        Filia takes children's privacy seriously and wants children and parents
        to understand that the Website is not intended for children under the
        age of 13. If you are under the age of 13, please do not use this
        Website. Filia does not permit anyone under the age of 13 to open an
        account here. Filia does not seek to collect personal information about
        children through our Website. If Filia becomes aware that a person
        submitting personal information to us through any part of our Website is
        a child under the age of 13, we delete the information as soon as we
        discover it and do not use it for any purpose, nor do we disclose it to
        third parties. Since Filia does not seek to collect any personal
        information about children, and delete information collected
        inadvertently as soon as it is discovered that a child has submitted it,
        Filia typically retains no information about children that could be
        reviewed or deleted. If a parent requests review or deletion of
        information about their child before Filia has discovered and deleted
        the information, Filia will of course honor that request. Please contact
        us at info@filia.solar.
      </p>
